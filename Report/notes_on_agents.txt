=== MICHAEL’S COMMENTS ===

FORWARDJUMPINGAGENT
Difficulty 00
- Seems like a fairly good AI
- Enemies are only goombas and flower guys s one rarely dies on them
- No gaps
- Just seems “sloppy”
- Misses out on opportunities for power ups, it could survive some situations with them

Difficulty 03
- By now the gaps become his biggest issue
- Enemies don’t help either

Difficulty 05
- Spikey shells start showing up more
- Every once and a while it still looks amazing :P


FORWARDJUMPINGAGENT2
Takeaway: Super simple improvements are hard!

Difficulty 00
- Goes back sometimes when it runs against something
- Unclear whether how helpful this actually is
- At least one situation where it got caught jumping against a wall
	- This was a very rare occurrence, and seemed to require things being at exactly 
		the worst positions >.<

Difficulty 03
- Saw at least one case where its new behavior put it in the path of a bullet :(
- And an enemy he had already avoided
- Does not seem to do what we wanted him to do , this is an action that requires a lot of control

Difficulty 05
- More things to jump off and more gaps leads this to get more dangerous :(

GP Agent
Note to self: Look into its methodology

Difficulty 0
- Best part is how much it spams the buttons
- Also seems to have similar behavior to forward jumping
- It has learned to wait for flower enemies (no matter the distance)
- It is also much better at killing enemies (with fire and jumping)

Difficulty 3
- It gets stuck behind a pipe :(
	- Because it doesn’t hold the jump button
- Gaps are still a killer! It doesn’t seem to consider them.

Difficulty 10
- Mario gets stuck (screenshot)

Rule Based Agent
Note to self: analyze 
Difficulty 0
- Love how it hits walls before it jumps
- It plays it safe in a way none of the other agents do
- Will sometimes stop before a dangerous jump
- Never breaks bricks! (why not get mushrooms/flowers?)
	- Might still be a calculated decision

Difficulty 3
- Saw Mario waiting under a ledge, enemy fell on top
- Doesn’t appear to be smart enough to not jump on spiky turtles
- Aside: it’s weird that none of those duck

Difficulty 5
- This thing is the master of edges
	- Fits on the pipe with the flower guy

Difficulty 10
- Bullet bills from behind are a major issue

AStar Agent
Difficulty 0
- Yes it fucking dominates everything

Amazing Agent (ours)
Note to self again: I am dumb, they reset speed because it shoots fireball

Difficulty 0
- Basically forward jumping
- Doesn’t jump into the plants!

Difficulty 3
- Crap when it catches a shell it stops! (second trial)
- Gets caught by bullets from behind :(
- But overall the stopping for enemies seems to be helpful!
